# Turn the Tables

## Who We Are

Turn the Tables is a new effort by workers in the tech industry to educate our fellow workers about their rights to organize and help empower them to do so.

We do this primarily through having a presence a tech conferences, which can include:

* tabling (ie in expo halls)
* providing resources such as books, zines, and flyers to conference attendees
* facilitating 1:1 conversations between conference attendees and labor lawyers, union organizers, and fellow tech workers who can answer their questions
* hosting happy hours, open spaces, workshops, and other places for workers to meet and get to know each other
* arranging conference talks, panels and posters as part of conference programming on topics related to organizing

This repository contains resources and links to resources for use by the Turn the Tables community or anyone else who wants to use them.

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to add a resource, feel free to create a pull request or open up an issue with a link and we can add it for you. Resources should be added as links in this readme. If you need a place to host a resource, you can add it to this repository's resource folder and then link it.

If you'd like help creating a resource, would like to bring Turn the Tables to a specific tech conference or meetup, would like to partner with us, or otherwise want to get involved in the project, please email `shaunagm` @ `gmail` . `com`.
